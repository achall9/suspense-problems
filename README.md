# suspense-problems

1. <Suspense> component that lets you “wait” for some code to load so it should be used with React.lazy.
2. And it should wrap the SuspensefulUserProfile component ( that is fetching data ) , not the UserProfile, because UserProfile is just rendering data after fetching
3. You should provide fallback to Suspense
